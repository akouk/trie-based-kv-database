# trie-based-kv-database
Trie-Based Key-Value Store for Distributed, Fault-Tolerant Database


## Data Generation Program
The data generation program is used to generate random data in the form of key-value pairs that can be stored in a key value store.

### Parameters
- "-k": a file containing a space-separated list of key names and their data types that can be used to generate tha data
- "-n": the number of data items to generate
- "-d": the maximum depth of nesting for the key-value pairs
- "-l": the maximum length of string values
- "-m": the maximum number of keys per nesting level

### Usage
To use the program, run the following command line
python3 dataCration.py -k keyFile.txt -n 1000 -d 3 -l 4 -m 5

### Data Format
The generated data is in the form of key-value pairs, where the value can contain additional key-value pairs nested to a certain depth. The values can be integers, floats, strings, or sets of key-value pairs. The top-level keys can be either random strings or keys in the form "key1", "key2", etc.

Note: The data generated by the program may not make sense and is intended for testing and development purposes only.
